## Detailed Findings

### 1. Weak Encryption Keys
**File:** `security/encryption_key.pem`  
**Impact:** Compromised encryption can expose sensitive user data to attackers.  
**Recommendations:**  
- Implement RSA-2048 or higher key standards.  
- Use a hardware security module (HSM) for key generation and management.  

---

### 2. API Vulnerabilities
**File:** `scripts/robot_manager_api.py`  
**Impact:** Lack of encryption or token-based authentication allows attackers to intercept API requests.  
**Recommendations:**  
- Enforce HTTPS across all endpoints.  
- Use JWT for secure and scalable authentication.  

---

### 3. Misconfigured Cloud Policies
**File:** `cloud/aws_integration.py`  
**Impact:** Overly permissive IAM roles can lead to unauthorized data access.  
**Recommendations:**  
- Implement least privilege principles.  
- Regularly audit IAM policies and access logs.  

---

## Proposed Mitigation Plan
1. **Enhanced Key Management:** Transition to advanced key standards and secure key storage solutions.  
2. **Authentication Improvements:** Deploy OAuth 2.0 for all API communications.  
3. **Access Controls:** Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin accounts.  
4. **Regular Security Audits:** Perform monthly vulnerability assessments using automated tools and manual reviews.

## Tools Used for Analysis
- **Burp Suite:** For analyzing API vulnerabilities.  
- **Nmap:** For network-level vulnerability detection.  
- **OWASP ZAP:** For identifying web application vulnerabilities.  
- **AWS Trusted Advisor:** For auditing cloud configurations.
