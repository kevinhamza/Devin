otheros_integration.py
-----------------------
This module provides integration for other operating systems not covered by primary integrations. 

Features:
- Executes OS-specific voice commands.
- Manages system resources, applications, files, and user settings.
- Offers complete control of the PC/OS environment, ensuring cross-platform compatibility.

Supported Platforms:
- Linux (extended features for distros like Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora).
- Android OS (via ADB for control and interaction).
- Unix-based systems (including BSDs and specialized systems).
