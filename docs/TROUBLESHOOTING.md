## General Troubleshooting Steps

1.  **Check Logs:** Scrutinize the logs in the `logs/` directory to uncover error messages.
2.  **Restart Services:** Reinitiate the application or affected services to refresh their state.
3.  **Verify Dependencies:** Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed correctly for seamless operation.
4.  **Update System:** Confirm you're utilizing the latest version of the software to benefit from bug fixes and enhancements.
5.  **Rebuild the Project:**

```bash
scripts/install.sh
Installation Issues
Symptom: Installation script fails

Cause: Missing permissions or incompatible dependency versions.

Solution:

Run with Administrative Privileges:
Bash

sudo ./scripts/install.sh
Verify Dependency Versions: Double-check the dependency versions listed in requirements.txt.
Symptom: Missing modules

Cause: Incorrect or incomplete installation.

Solution: Reinstall using the installation script for a clean setup.

Configuration Errors
Symptom: .env file not found

Cause: Misplaced or missing .env file, crucial for configuration.

Solution:

Locate .env: Search for the .env file in the root directory.
Regenerate (if missing): If missing, create it by copying .env.example to .env.
Module-Specific Problems
AI Integrations
Symptom: API connection fails

Cause: Invalid API keys or network connectivity issues.

Solution:

Verify API Keys: Ensure the API keys in config/api_keys.json are accurate and valid.
Check Network Connectivity: Confirm a stable internet connection for successful communication.
Database
Symptom: Database migration errors

Cause: Schema conflicts or outdated migration scripts.

Solution: Run the migration script to resolve any schema discrepancies:

Bash

python scripts/migrate_data.py
Robot Manager
Symptom: Robot does not respond to commands

Cause: Communication failure or misconfiguration.

Solution:

Verify Robot Connectivity: Ensure the robot can be reached by the system.
Reconfigure (if needed): If necessary, use scripts/robot_configurator.py to reconfigure the robot.
Performance Issues
Symptom: High CPU or memory usage

Cause: Inefficient queries or excessive processing within modules.

Solution:

Monitor Resource Usage: Utilize these commands to monitor resource usage:
Bash

python monitoring/cpu_usage.py
python monitoring/memory_tracker.py
Optimize Affected Module: Pinpoint and optimize the module causing the performance bottleneck.
Error Logs
Locating Logs
All logs are meticulously stored within the logs/ directory for reference and troubleshooting purposes. Utilize scripts/cleanup_old_logs.py to maintain log size.
