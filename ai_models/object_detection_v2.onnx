# File: ai_models/object_detection_v2.onnx
# Purpose: Optimized model for object detection, capable of identifying objects in real-time from video streams and images. Includes metadata for deployment in AI applications.

MODEL DESCRIPTION:
- Format: ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange)
- Input Dimensions: Dynamic shape support with [Batch Size, Channels, Height, Width]
- Output: Bounding box coordinates, confidence scores, and class labels
- Optimized for: Low latency and high accuracy on edge devices (IoT, mobile platforms)
- Pretrained Dataset: COCO 2021
- Architecture: YOLOv5 derivative with streamlined computation
- Framework Compatibility: PyTorch, TensorFlow, ONNX Runtime

FUNCTIONALITIES:
1. Detect objects in static images and live video feeds.
2. Provide robust bounding boxes with adjustable thresholds.
3. Configurable for lightweight and high-performance inference.
4. Scalable integration for API-based queries and cloud-hosted deployments.

MODEL OPTIMIZATIONS:
- Pruned unnecessary layers for reduced computational cost.
- Quantized for compatibility with edge devices.
- Supports real-time processing at 60 FPS on GPUs.
- Integrated preprocessing steps for resizing and normalization.

NOTES:
1. Ensure ONNX runtime is installed to leverage its capabilities.
2. Includes hooks for deployment in robotics and smart systems.
